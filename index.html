                        Sky Tech Universal was founded by BRIGHT BONG’ANI SHEPHERD 
                        KUNDA MULOMBA JUNIOR, after noticing what he passed through 
                        as a self made developer. Bright was introduced to development 
                        by his friend LESTER PHIRI who was also introduced to development 
                        by BLESSED JASION MWANZA who founded ALOMO SYSTEM and AFRILENDING.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bright saw that the journey of a self made developer was hard because 
                        of factors such as tutoring, developer environment, and developer 
                        equipment’s etcetera. After learning the importance of development 
                        and how much problems it can solver he came up with the idea of SKY 
                        TECH UNIVERSAL, With the Aim of creating different opportunities in 
                        Development, creating a suitable environment for junior.......
